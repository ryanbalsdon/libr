# R Library
 This library is a collection of useful, free, single-file libraries for C. The focus of these modules is on ease-of-use, clarity and stability. It will be slower and consume more memory than custom or larger implementations.

## Why Single-File?
 Single-File libraries are easier to deal with! They're small enough that they can be included into a project as source which brings two main benefits: they're much easier to use when debugging and we don't have to worry about low-level formats of pre-built libraries.

## Why Free?
 Putting these libs into the public domain makes them even easier to use and usefulness is the main goal of the project.

## Instructions and Documentation
 There are some examples in the test/ folder and a smaple makefile in the project's root. The tests can be run with 'make test'.
